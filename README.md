### Where is the normal README for this repository?

In 2021, I began creating dedicated /Documentation branches in the repositories I have forked in Github, in order to better document why I forked that repository and what work I had done or intended to do in it.

In order to see the official readme, please switch to the main or master branch.

### Code Contributions

My local branch feature/fixSvgSize was accepted and merged into the upstream repository.

My local branch feature/allowMoveNumbersGreaterThan10 
  * Allows the use of numbers >10 for moves, if the diagram is not written in compact notation
  * And fixes a bug where move #2 does not render the number in the center of the stone.

### Repository Purpose

I personally use this repository as an Obsidian plugin, and find it useful when studying Go/Baduk/Weiqi.
